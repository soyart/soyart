### Henlo 👋

I'm Prem Phansuriyanon:

- a back-end dev by trade

- really passionate about re-inventing the wheel

- use what I write

- love to share my shitty code projects to the world

### Personal projects me and my friends find useful

- 🛠️ [ALI](https://github.com/soyart/ali) and [ali-rs](https://github.com/soyart/ali-rs)

  ALI is an Declarative Arch Linux installer spec (think cloud-init), and ali-rs is the Rust implementation.

- 🤓 [soytrie](https://github.com/soyart/soytrie)

  A Rust trie library backed by standard library `HashMap`. It's a spin-off from [actix-drop](https://github.com/soyart/actix-drop).

- 📝 [actix-drop](https://github.com/soyart/actix-drop)

  A Rust back-end for storing byte clipboards. It supports basic HTML front-end, or JSON/plain text requests and responses. Now, only HTTP is supported, although I plan to add TCP support as well.

- 🔒 [gfc](https://github.com/soyart/gfc)

  My first actual program! This CLI program is used to encrypt/decrypt with AES256, (X)ChaCha20-Poly1305, and RSA.

- 🔒 [rfc](https://github.com/soyart/rfc)

  A Rust gfc clone

- 🛠️ [gsl](https://github.com/soyart/gsl)

  gsl is short for Go Soylib. Yes, it is a stupid *library* where I put in code that I expect might be useful tomorrow.

- 💰 [FnGoBot](https://github.com/soyart/fngobot)

  A Telegram chat bot for tracking/alerting prices from financial markets.

- 💩 [stubborn](https://github.com/soyart/stubborn)

  A caching DoH (DNS-ver-HTTPS) resolver, with extra Redis support to make it all slower!

### Small useful programs for devs

- 💻 [rd.js](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix/-/blob/main/utils/bin/rd.js) - a CLI JavaScipt snippet that use macOS Disk Utility.app (`diskutil`) to create a ramdisk.

- #️⃣ [csc](https://github.com/soyart/csc) - a simple CLI tool to generate checksum, with optional comparison.

- 🔤 [cases](https://github.com/soyart/cases) a simple CLI tool that just prints the uppercased/lowercased versions of given CLI arguments.

Apart from a "program", there's also a [collection of shell scripts](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix). These scripts were the first code I wrote.

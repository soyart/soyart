### Henlo 👋

I'm [@artnoi](https://twitter.com/artnoi). Read my blog on [artnoi.com](https://artnoi.com). I currently work at [Cleverse](https://cleverse.com) as a software engineer, developing its dApp projects.

> 🎓 I went to a business school, but found job in tech.

My first ever _language_ was the UNIX shell. After learning actual programming, I just code in newer compiled languages like Go or Rust because of better tooling and developer experience, although I had written code in Python and JavaScript-family before.

### Personal projects me and my friends find useful

- 🤓 [soytrie](https://github.com/artnoi43/soytrie) - a Rust trie library backed by standard library `HashMap`. It's a spin-off from [actix-drop](https://github.com/artnoi43/actix-drop).

- 📝 [actix-drop](https://github.com/artnoi43/actix-drop) - a Rust back-end for storing byte clipboards. It supports basic HTML front-end, or JSON/plain text requests and responses. Now, only HTTP is supported, although I plan to add TCP support as well.

- 🔒 [gfc](https://github.com/artnoi43/gfc) - my first Go code! This CLI program is used to encrypt/decrypt with AES256, (X)ChaCha20-Poly1305, and RSA.

- 🛠️ [gsl](https://github.com/artnoi43/gsl) - gsl is short for Go Soylib. Yes, it is a stupid *library* where I put in code that I expect might be useful tomorrow.

- 💰 [FnGoBot](https://github.com/artnoi43/fngobot) - a Telegram chat bot for tracking/alerting prices from financial markets.

- 💩 [stubborn](https://github.com/artnoi43/stubborn) - a caching DoH (DNS-ver-HTTPS) resolver, with extra Redis support to make it all slower!

### Small useful programs for devs

- 💻 [rd.js](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix/-/blob/main/utils/bin/rd.js) - a CLI JavaScipt snippet that use macOS Disk Utility.app (`diskutil`) to create a ramdisk.

- #️⃣ [csc](https://github.com/artnoi43/csc) - a simple CLI tool to generate checksum, with optional comparison.

- 🔤 [cases](https://github.com/artnoi43/cases) a simple CLI tool that just prints the uppercased/lowercased versions of given CLI arguments.

Apart from a "program", there's also a [collection of shell scripts](https://gitlab.com/artnoi/unix). These scripts were the first code I wrote.
